# [My Knowledge Wiki ðŸŒ¿](https://wiki.karimould.dev)

I learn and re-learn a lot of things and try to write them down in a place where I can find them again and recall them.
Besides that, by being on the internet every day, I find many interesting/cool/usefull/beautiful things, which I want to document in the same way.

This "wiki" or "digital garden" should help me to write down this knowledge in a structured way and make it reusable.
